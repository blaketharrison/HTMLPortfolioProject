    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>There are few things sweeter than seeing your hard work pay off in the form of a clean beautifly crafted web page come to life on the Web! My favorite language to code in is JavaScript.
    To me JavaScript is the breath of life that makes the difference between a piece of pager and a dynamic web site.</p>

    <h3>What I Know</h3>
    <p>I truely enjoy writing front-end code. This is what people see when they come to your site and without good front-end development,
    the first impression you will make or break the users experience.</p>
